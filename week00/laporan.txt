Week00 Reports

There are two tasks on the first week.

The first task was to reply the forum message to proof my presence.
So I reply the forum by saying Hello and introduce myself.

The second task requires more effort. These are the things that I did:
	1. Google account, I had a google account, so I skip this step.
	2. GitHub account, I also had an account, so I skip this step.
	3. I create a public repository with the name "os162"
	4. I logged in to my google account to fill a form
	5. Then I have to wait 24 hours to check my status as registered

That is what I did last week.
