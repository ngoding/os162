Week01 Reports

So far, there is only one task. But this task is more complicated than last week

So the first 32 objective is about learning how to use git, badak, and editor.
So I learned much from this task.

I think it is very interesting to use UNIX and Git because we only have to use
the keyboard to do everything. So cool.
